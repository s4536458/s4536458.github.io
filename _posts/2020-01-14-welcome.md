# Question 1 Blog by Anjana Nanayakkara

# About me
I am an electrical engineering student, at the Univeristy of Queensland. 
Whilst my passion is power system studies, I have always been intrigued by AI. 
The purpose of this blog is to outline key concepts I have learned from the 
[FastAI](https://course.fast.ai/) course.

## Posts

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `filename` is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. `.md` is the file extension for markdown files.

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a "*level 1 heading*" in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line `## File names` above.
