## What is a Neural Network?
As discussed by [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/neural-networks), neural networks are a fundamental component of deep learning models.
They consists of **node layers**. Each node is designated a certain weight and threshold. 
As shown below, the **input** layers are related to the **output** layers via multiple hidden layers:
