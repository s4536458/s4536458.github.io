# Foundation of Neural Networks
## What is a Neural Network?
Neural networks are a fundamental component of deep learning models.

They consists of **node** layers. Each node is designated a certain weight and threshold. 

As shown below, the **input** layers are related to the **output** layers via multiple hidden layers.
