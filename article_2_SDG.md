# Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Method

As discussed in [Article 1](article_1_DL_Explained.md), Deep Learning models require a **mechanism** to update the model parameters automatically. The **Stochastic gradient descent (SGD)** is the mathematical foundation of this mechanism. 

## Step 1: Initialize
- Gradient descent method involves starting at a random point on a function
- Then, travel down the slope after each iteration, until the function minimum is reached

## Step 2:
